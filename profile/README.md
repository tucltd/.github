### 11/03/2024 10:36 - Made the mistake of asking more questions to Phil

Revisions are now variations
On PAF update if the change is significant i.e. affects design work then this will create a variation because design work may have to be redone changing project timelines.

Variation = New Form (big change 5 new houses add to plot - job is different now)

Version = any section updated (silly little change i.e. solicitor phone number changed)

### 8/03/2024 - Jacky's questions for Ross

End Customers and Contractors, who fills in the PAIF and who do we give accounts to?
need end customer field in project table, contractors can have multiple clients with projects Both need to login

can a project have more than 1 customer and 1 end customer?
projects can have 1 customer and multiple end customers
projects can have multiple PAF forms

Can have 2 enquiry types do we need to worry about commercial domestic

Add isGasDom/Com/elec/wat to project table & second enquiry type

be able to add and remove utilities after project is created

Form builder should be Send form where user selects customer account(s) they want to notify via email. Keep select options on form sender, should the selections be linked to the project table? (if gas commercial is selected in project table it is already ticked in form, if then unticked it is removed from the project table) pre populate from database but unticking doesnt remove it

are we including turnkey? can it be turnkey and another enquiry type? only turn key
fibre? yes

Can the PAIF go on hold? or just the project - just project
Last Updated and by who for Customer POV projects table - status, last updated, change 'Projects' to 'Post Acceptance Forms'

Approve and Deny PAIF?
